This software is in an alpha stage of development and I do not plan on
releasing ready-to-run builds until a stable v1.0 release. However, it
is very easy to run it yourself. Just grab the free and open source
[Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org), import the `project.godot`
file, and hit the play button.
